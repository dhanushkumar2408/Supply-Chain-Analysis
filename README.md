# Supply-Chain-Analysis

 

## **Data Cleaning Process**

The data cleaning process was an essential step in preparing the dataset for analysis and modeling. Below are the steps performed during data cleaning:

### **1. Dropping Unwanted / Unnecessary Columns**
   - Removed columns that were irrelevant to the analysis or redundant. This reduced noise and improved computational efficiency.
   - Example: Columns like `Customer Password` or `Product Image` were dropped as they didnâ€™t contribute to the analysis objectives.


### **2. Renaming Columns**
   - Standardized column names for better readability and uniformity.
   - Example:
     - Changed `Shipping date(DateOrders)` to `Shipping Date`.
     - Renamed `Order date (DateOrders)` to `Order Date`.

### **3. Changing Column Types**
   - **Date Conversion**:
     - Used `pd.to_datetime` to convert `Shipping Date`, `Order Date`, and other date-related columns into a standard datetime format.
     - Ensured consistency in date-time operations for further analysis.
   - **Integer to Object Conversion**:
     - Changed specific columns like `Order ID` or `Product Category ID` from `Integer` to `Object` type as they represented categorical data.

### **4. Merging with USA Holiday List**
   - Merged the primary dataset (Supply Chain dataset) with a USA holiday list to identify orders occurring on or near public holidays.
   - New columns derived:
     - `Is_Holiday`: Boolean column indicating if the order date coincided with a holiday.
     - Extracted date-related components:
       - `Month`, `Year`, `Day`, `Weekday`.
   - Filled null values in the holiday column with a placeholder string `'Non-Holiday'`.

# Random Forest Regressor Findings for Predicting Sales

### Model Overview
We used a **Random Forest Regressor** to identify the importance of various features in predicting sales. The model was trained with the following features:
- `Order Item Discount Rate`
- `Product Price`
- `Order Item Quantity`
- `Total Profit Per Order`

The target variable (`y`) was `Sales`.
![Screenshot 2024-11-16 191822](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac6af898-9d25-464c-8cf4-c8e364ebb5af)



### **Feature Importance Analysis**

Using the trained Random Forest model, the importance of each feature was calculated, and the results are summarized below:

#### **1. Product Price**
- **Importance Score**: Close to **0.8**.
- **Insights**: This feature is the most critical factor for predicting sales. It highlights that the price of a product has a substantial impact on the sales volume or revenue.

#### **2. Order Item Quantity**
- **Importance Score**: Around **0.2**.
- **Insights**: The quantity of items ordered is the second most significant feature. While it contributes to sales predictions, its influence is notably less than that of the product price.

#### **3. Order Item Discount Rate**
- **Importance Score**: Relatively low.
- **Insights**: Discounts on items have a limited impact on predicting sales in this dataset. Although discounts may affect consumer behavior in some contexts, their predictive power here is minimal.

#### **4. Total Profit Per Order**
- **Importance Score**: Almost negligible.
- **Insights**: Profit margins seem to have little to no influence on predicting sales. This suggests that the sales volume is not directly tied to profitability for individual orders in this dataset.



### **Visual Representation**

Below is a bar plot showcasing the feature importance:


![Screenshot 2024-11-16 183740](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6d85416-358c-4f2e-9201-22bd655bd24b)


### **Key Takeaways**
- **Product Price** is the dominant driver of sales predictions.
- **Order Item Quantity** also plays a role, but to a lesser extent.
- **Order Item Discount Rate** and **Total Profit Per Order** have minimal influence on the model, indicating they may not be critical factors for predicting sales in this context.

### **Recommendations**
- Focus on optimizing product pricing strategies, as they have the most significant impact on sales.
- Consider analyzing the role of discounts and profits further, especially in cases where these features might affect specific customer segments or categories.

# Multiple Linear Regression Findings for Predicting Sales

### **Model Overview**
We developed a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to predict `Sales` using the following features:
- `Days for shipping (real)`
- `Days for shipment (scheduled)`
- `Product Price`
- `Order Item Quantity`
![Screenshot 2024-11-16 192413](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c02eac9b-81e5-4169-aaf8-00779ad5269c)


The model's performance was evaluated on a test dataset using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (RÂ²)** metrics.


### **Performance Metrics**

#### **1. Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1312.08**
- **Definition**: MSE measures the average squared difference between actual values and predicted values.
- **Interpretation**:  
  - An MSE of **1312.08** indicates the average squared deviation between the predicted sales and the actual sales is 1312.08 units.  
  - While this value suggests how far off predictions are on average, its scale depends on the target variable, so it is often challenging to interpret MSE in isolation.  
  - A lower MSE is desirable, as it signifies better prediction accuracy.

#### **2. R-squared (RÂ²): 0.924**
- **Definition**: RÂ² represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (`Sales`) explained by the independent variables.
- **Interpretation**:  
  - An RÂ² of **0.924** means that **92.4%** of the variance in `Sales` is explained by the predictors (`Days for shipping (real)`, `Days for shipment (scheduled)`, `Product Price`, and `Order Item Quantity`).  
  - This is an excellent fit, as it indicates the model explains most of the variability in the sales data.  
  - The closer RÂ² is to 1, the better the model explains the variability in the target variable.
 
 
### **Insights**
- **High RÂ²** suggests the linear model captures a significant portion of the relationship between the features and `Sales`. 
- However, the **MSE** indicates there is still room to improve the model's predictive accuracy, especially when dealing with large variations in sales values.


### **Key Recommendations**
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional predictors (e.g., seasonality, region, or customer-specific factors) that might further improve predictions.
- **Residual Analysis**: Analyze residuals to check for patterns, outliers, or assumptions violations, such as non-linearity or heteroscedasticity.
- **Model Comparison**: Compare this linear regression model with other algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to assess if non-linear models perform better on this dataset.

### **Conclusion**
The high RÂ² value demonstrates that the model fits the data well, while the MSE suggests prediction errors could be optimized further. This linear regression provides a strong baseline for sales prediction.

![Screenshot 2024-11-16 192135](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47338995-396e-492e-922c-bb1259cd220f)


### **Key Metrics**
- **R-squared**: **26%**
  - This indicates that 26% of the variation in 'Total Profit Per Order' is explained by the independent variables in the model. While this is relatively low, it suggests that other factors not included in the model also influence total profit.


### **Independent Variables and Coefficients**

1. **Order Item Discount Rate**:
   - **Coefficient**: **-65.2753**
   - **Interpretation**: For every unit increase in the discount rate (e.g., 100% increase), the **Total Profit Per Order decreases by 65.2753 units** on average, holding other variables constant.
   - **Statistical Significance**: The coefficient is statistically significant (**p-value < 0.05**), meaning the relationship is unlikely due to chance.

2. **Product Price**:
   - **Coefficient**: **0.1393**
   - **Interpretation**: For every 1-unit increase in product price, the **Total Profit Per Order increases by 0.1393 units** on average, holding other variables constant.
   - **Statistical Significance**: The coefficient is statistically significant (**p-value < 0.05**), suggesting a strong positive correlation.

3. **Order Item Quantity**:
   - **Coefficient**: **34.7414**
   - **Interpretation**: For every additional item sold, the **Total Profit Per Order increases by 34.7414 units** on average, holding other variables constant.
   - **Statistical Significance**: The coefficient is statistically significant (**p-value < 0.05**), demonstrating a strong positive correlation.


### **Conclusion**

- **Order Item Discount Rate** has a significant **negative impact** on Total Profit Per Order. Strategies to minimize excessive discounts could help improve profitability.
- **Product Price** and **Order Item Quantity** both have a significant **positive impact** on Total Profit Per Order. This highlights the importance of pricing strategy and increasing sales volume to drive profitability.
- The relatively low **R-squared (26%)** suggests that other factors not included in this model play a significant role in determining total profit.


### **Recommendations**
1. **Review discounting policies** to balance competitive pricing with profitability.
2. **Optimize product pricing** to maximize profit margins while maintaining sales volume.
3. Focus on **increasing order quantities** through promotional bundles or volume discounts.
